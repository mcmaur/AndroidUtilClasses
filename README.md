> Android made easier

Android documentation is bad: 20 pages long explanation and few code example covering 1% of the code you need.
Udacity videos are so long that you can spend an entire day to do a 4 minute of code.

**_I have a solution_**: my super easy recap. All code and some few instructions to deal with.

### How To Use It:
- Read the README and follow the few basic instructions
- Import the java classes into your project

**Done!**

Easy.
