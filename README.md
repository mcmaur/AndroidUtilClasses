# AndroidUtilClasses

If you find android documentation is bad you are welcome here.
I think 20 pages long explanation and few code example covering 1% of the code you need, so I've a super easy recap of what I know. All code and some few instruction to deal.

HOW TO USE IT

*Read the README: follow few basic instruction
*Import the java classes

Done!

Easy.
